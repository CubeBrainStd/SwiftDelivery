# CubeBrain Labs repository security policy

In CubeBrain Labs we know that no technology is perfect, however, we seek maximum security and reliability in our projects, so we decided to open many of our projects to the public in free repositories like this one, where everyone can support us and help us to improve.

Due to the security policies of the team, all contributors must follow the security guidelines stipulated in this document.

## Guidelines:

We ask that you:

 - Do everything possible to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience, disruption of production systems, and destruction or manipulation of data.
 - Use exploits only to the extent necessary to confirm a vulnerability; do not exploit a vulnerability for profit. Do not use an exploit to compromise or exfiltrate data, establish command line access and/or persistence, or use the exploit to "pivot" to other systems. Once you have established that a vulnerability exists or have found any of the sensitive information described below, stop your testing and notify us immediately.
 - Please do not modify, store or access data that does not belong to you. Instead, use your own accounts and/or credentials for security research purposes.

## How to report a vulnerability:

In case you find a vulnerability you should report it to the CubeBrain Labs team by different means.

 - In case it is a minor problem, publish an issue in the corresponding repository.
 - In case it is an issue where its publication could be detrimental to the project, communicate with us via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Cubebrainstd), or on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/vkJH9EUBsF) server.
